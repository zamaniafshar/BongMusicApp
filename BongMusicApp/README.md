## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a **feature-driven architecture**, which keeps the codebase organized, scalable, and easy to maintain. The core business logic is decoupled from the UI using the **BLoC pattern** for state management.

- **`lib/features`**: Contains the primary application features (e.g., player, playlists, search).
- **`lib/common`**: Holds shared widgets, constants, and utilities used across multiple features.
- **`lib/config`**: Manages application-level configurations like routing (`go_router`) and themes.
- **`lib/main.dart`**: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing services and setting up the root widget.

Dependency injection is handled by `get_it`, which provides a clean way to access services and BLoCs throughout the app.
